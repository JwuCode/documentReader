Generalization to Non-integer Nodes

Let’s now remove the restriction that the “nodes” xo, 21, Z2, .... be precisely the numbers
0, 1, 2, etc. We will still require them to be equidistant, however. That is, we'll require that
In = X + nh for n = 0,1,2,... (so h is the distance between each pair of nodes). Non-
equidistant nodes can also be dealt with, but we won’t investigate that case in this course.
To find the appropriate form of the interpolating polynomials, we would repeat the proce-
dure we used to find formula (30). The calculations are a bit messier, so we won’t go through

them here; instead we’ll just state the result.

The Newton Forward Difference Formula Given n+ 1 equidistant nodes zo, tn =

xo + nh, the n'-order polynomial passing through all of them is given by
